# Cardiovascular disease prediction

This repository contains the Python code and dataset used for the development of the final project for the course SSIE 637 - Advanced Topics in Health Systems during the Fall 2019 period. The objective of this study consisted in developing multiple machine learning classification models (i.e. logistic regression, support vector machine, k nearest neighbor, decision tree, random forest and Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier) capable of predicting and  identifying the presence of cardiovascular disease in patients based on multiple medical features. The focus of this study was to compare the models’ performance by obtaining key process indicators after a 5-fold cross validation analysis, in order to identify the one with the highest accuracy rate, and thus, the one that can lead to better decision making and better medical outcomes. This constitutes a decision-making support system for physicians and researchers to help predict cardiovascular diseases in patients in advance.
